# Library of Alexandria - Multi-Agent Implementation Work Notes
Started: 2024-03-20

## Phase 0: Planning and Analysis
--------------------------------

### Current Status
- Analyzed existing codebase architecture
- Reviewed PydanticAI documentation
- Defined initial agent architecture
- Created implementation strategy

### Implementation Plan

1. Core Infrastructure Setup
   - Message bus system using PydanticAI's structured messaging
   - Shared context store for agent communication
   - Base agent classes and interfaces
   - Dependency injection system

2. Agent Migration Order
   a. Librarian Prime (Orchestrator)
   b. Content Curator & Taxonomy Master
   c. Connection Weaver
   d. Remaining agents in Phase 2 & 3

### Questions to Address

1. Data Flow
   - How will we handle state management between agents?
   - What's the best way to implement the message bus?
   - How should we structure the shared context store?

2. Performance Considerations
   - How to handle concurrent agent operations?
   - What's the best way to manage agent resource allocation?
   - How to implement efficient message routing?

3. Integration Points
   - How to maintain backward compatibility during migration?
   - What's the best way to integrate with existing Streamlit UI?
   - How to handle existing document processing pipeline?

### Next Steps

1. Create base agent infrastructure
   - Define message types
   - Set up dependency injection
   - Implement basic message routing

2. Begin Librarian Prime implementation
   - Convert existing UI interactions
   - Set up task delegation
   - Implement context management

### Technical Considerations

1. PydanticAI Integration
   - Using Agent class for each specialized agent
   - Leveraging RunContext for dependency injection
   - Implementing structured responses
   - Setting up streaming capabilities

2. Existing System Integration
   - Maintaining ChromaDB integration
   - Preserving document processing pipeline
   - Keeping tag system functionality
   - Ensuring knowledge graph operations

## Work Log
-----------

[2024-03-20]
- Created initial work notes
- Analyzed implementation requirements
- Defined phase 0 planning steps
- Identified key technical considerations

Next Update: Will begin implementation of core infrastructure and base agent classes.

## TODO
-------
[ ] Define message types and communication protocols
[ ] Set up base agent infrastructure
[ ] Implement message bus system
[ ] Create shared context store
[ ] Begin Librarian Prime implementation

## Notes
--------
- Will update this file as we progress through implementation
- Each major milestone will be documented
- Technical decisions and their rationale will be logged
- Issues and their resolutions will be tracked
