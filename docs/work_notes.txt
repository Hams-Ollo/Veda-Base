# Library of Alexandria - Multi-Agent Implementation Work Notes
Started: 2024-03-20

## Phase 0: Planning and Analysis
--------------------------------

### Current Status
- Analyzed existing codebase architecture
- Reviewed PydanticAI documentation
- Defined initial agent architecture
- Created implementation strategy

### Implementation Plan

1. Core Infrastructure Setup
   - Message bus system using PydanticAI's structured messaging ✓
   - Shared context store for agent communication ✓
   - Base agent classes and interfaces ✓
   - Dependency injection system ✓

2. Agent Migration Order
   a. Librarian Prime (Orchestrator) - In Progress
   b. Content Curator & Taxonomy Master
   c. Connection Weaver
   d. Remaining agents in Phase 2 & 3

### Questions to Address

1. Data Flow
   - How will we handle state management between agents? ✓ (Using SharedDependencies)
   - What's the best way to implement the message bus? ✓ (Implemented async message queue)
   - How should we structure the shared context store? ✓ (Using PydanticAI's RunContext)

2. Performance Considerations
   - How to handle concurrent agent operations? ✓ (Using asyncio)
   - What's the best way to manage agent resource allocation? ✓ (Through message bus)
   - How to implement efficient message routing? ✓ (Using subscription system)

3. Integration Points
   - How to maintain backward compatibility during migration?
   - What's the best way to integrate with existing Streamlit UI?
   - How to handle existing document processing pipeline?

### Next Steps

1. Create base agent infrastructure ✓
   - Define message types ✓
   - Set up dependency injection ✓
   - Implement basic message routing ✓

2. Begin Librarian Prime implementation ✓
   - Convert existing UI interactions ✓
   - Set up task delegation ✓
   - Implement context management ✓

3. Next Priority: Implement Content Curator Agent
   - Document processing capabilities
   - Content analysis integration
   - Quality assessment features

### Technical Considerations

1. PydanticAI Integration
   - Using Agent class for each specialized agent ✓
   - Leveraging RunContext for dependency injection ✓
   - Implementing structured responses ✓
   - Setting up streaming capabilities ✓

2. Existing System Integration
   - Maintaining ChromaDB integration
   - Preserving document processing pipeline
   - Keeping tag system functionality
   - Ensuring knowledge graph operations

## TODO
-------
[x] Define message types and communication protocols
[x] Set up base agent infrastructure
[x] Implement message bus system
[x] Create shared context store
[x] Begin Librarian Prime implementation
[ ] Implement Content Curator Agent
[ ] Implement Taxonomy Master Agent
[ ] Integrate with existing document processing
[ ] Set up agent monitoring system

## Notes
--------
- Core infrastructure is now in place using PydanticAI
- Message bus system supports both direct and broadcast messages
- Librarian Prime can coordinate complex workflows
- Next focus will be on specialized agents
- Need to carefully integrate with existing systems
