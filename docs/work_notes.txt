Work Notes - Library of Alexandria
============================

Current Status (2024-01-06):
---------------------------
1. UI Implementation:
   ✅ Modern dark theme interface
   ✅ Consistent button styling across pages
   ✅ Streamlined navigation
   ✅ Chat interface with fixed input bar
   ✅ Quick actions on dashboard

2. Document Processing:
   ❌ Issue: Document processor not working correctly
   - Error: 'DocumentProcessor' object has no attribute 'register_handler'
   - Need to investigate DocumentProcessor implementation
   - May need to update processor interface

3. Multi-Agent System:
   ✅ Message Bus initialization
   ✅ Librarian Prime Agent setup
   ✅ Domain Specialist Factory
   ✅ Knowledge Graph Factory
   ✅ Taxonomy Master Factory

4. Features Implemented:
   ✅ Multi-file upload support
   ✅ Duplicate file detection
   ✅ File cleanup options
   ✅ System status monitoring
   ✅ Recent activity tracking
   ✅ Chat interface with history

Known Issues:
------------
1. Document Processing:
   - Document processor throwing 'register_handler' error
   - Need to verify processor factory implementation
   - May need to update process_files function

2. UI/UX:
   - Multiple "Starting Library of Alexandria Multi-Agent System..." messages
   - Need to clean up initialization logging

Next Steps:
----------
1. Fix document processing:
   - Debug DocumentProcessor implementation
   - Update processor interface if needed
   - Add better error handling

2. Improve system stability:
   - Clean up initialization process
   - Reduce redundant system messages
   - Add proper error recovery

3. Enhance features:
   - Implement knowledge graph visualization
   - Add document preview
   - Improve chat context handling

4. Testing needed:
   - Document processing pipeline
   - Multi-agent communication
   - Error handling scenarios
   - File type support verification

Dependencies to Check:
--------------------
- DocumentProcessor implementation
- Agent communication protocols
- File processing pipeline
- Message bus stability

Notes:
-----
- Current focus should be on fixing document processing
- Need to investigate why processor initialization is failing
- Consider adding more detailed logging for debugging
- May need to review agent factory implementations
